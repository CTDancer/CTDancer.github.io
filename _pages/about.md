# **About Me**
Hi, I'm Tong Chen!

I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at Fudan University. Currently, I am a research intern at [Chatterjee Lab](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/) at Duke University, advised by [Prof. Pranam Chatterjee](https://bme.duke.edu/people/pranam-chatterjee/). Previously, I interned at [Qing Yuan Research Institute](http://www.qingyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en) at SJTU under the guidance of [Prof. Dequan Wang](https://dequan.wang/). 

My research experience spans Computer Vision, Large Language Models, and AI for biology. I am now dedicated to leveraging AI to accelerate drug discovery and development while improving success rates. My life goal is to cure diseases and alleviate suffering for all living beings on this planet, and I am committed to making this a reality.
